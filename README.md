Usage: python Scripts/AORegistration.py

N.B. This application is designed to perform the alignment algorithm on an HPF cluster.
Currently some paths are hard coded. These include a local mapping to the user directory on the cluster
/home/tom/hpf2
and the user account on the cluster:
tomwright@hpf.ccm.sickkids.ca 
SSH trusted key access must be setup to enable login to the cluster.
